    <h3 class="introduction">Car crash at the Nithi Bridge<h3>
    <p>Monday morning was a sad day for the residents of Tharaka Nithi county after a bus crashed at the Nithi bridge and fell into the river claiming two lives and causing multiple injuries to the passengers. The crash is believed to be caused after the driver lost control of the vehicle under the influence of alcohol. The bus gained speed and crashed into the bridge. The Nithi bridge has been a spotlight in the rescent years as it has claimed the lives of many people. the road leading to the bridge is a steep slope hence drivers find it hard to control their vehicles while driving down the slope. The residents of Tharaka Nithi county have pleaded with the county goverment to install reflectors along the road s it is hard to clearly depict the road tracks while driving at night

    <p>Bridges have been a large cause of road accidents over the rescent years as many of them are not clearly depicted out making it even harder for the road users to use the bridges at night. Another bridge that is a blackspot is the Mombasa bridge which has also claimed its fair share of lives. The government is urged to pit up road safety measures in bridges to reduce the  number of lives lost. our hearts go out to the families and friends who lost their loved ones</p>
